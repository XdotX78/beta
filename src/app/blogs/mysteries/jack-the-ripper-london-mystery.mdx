The autumn of 1888 cast a long shadow over the Whitechapel district of London, marked by a series of brutal and unsolved murders attributed to the infamous figure known only as "Jack the Ripper." The identity of the killer remains one of history's most enduring mysteries, fueling speculation and investigation for over a century.

### The Canonical Five

While numerous attacks occurred in Whitechapel during this period, five victims are commonly accepted as the "canonical" victims of Jack the Ripper due to the specific nature of their injuries and the timing of their deaths:

1.  **Mary Ann Nichols:**
    *   **Date:** August 31, 1888
    *   **Location:** Buck's Row (now Durward Street), Whitechapel
    *   **Details:** Found in the early morning, Nichols is considered the first canonical victim.

2.  **Annie Chapman:**
    *   **Date:** September 8, 1888
    *   **Location:** Backyard of 29 Hanbury Street, Spitalfields
    *   **Details:** Discovered later the same morning, Chapman's murder showed increased brutality.

3.  **Elizabeth Stride:**
    *   **Date:** September 30, 1888 (Part of the "Double Event")
    *   **Location:** Dutfield's Yard, off Berner Street (now Henriques Street), Whitechapel
    *   **Details:** Found shortly after 1 a.m., Stride's throat was cut, but she lacked the further mutilations seen in other victims, leading some to speculate the killer was interrupted.

4.  **Catherine Eddowes:**
    *   **Date:** September 30, 1888 (Part of the "Double Event")
    *   **Location:** Mitre Square, Aldgate (City of London)
    *   **Details:** Killed less than an hour after Stride and a short distance away, Eddowes suffered severe abdominal mutilation. Her murder occurred within the City of London, distinct from the other Whitechapel murders handled by the Metropolitan Police.

5.  **Mary Jane Kelly:**
    *   **Date:** November 9, 1888
    *   **Location:** 13 Miller's Court, off Dorset Street, Spitalfields (her residence)
    *   **Details:** Kelly's murder was the most gruesome, occurring indoors, which allowed the killer significantly more time. Her body was extensively mutilated.

Despite numerous suspects, extensive police investigations at the time, and countless theories proposed since, the true identity of Jack the Ripper has never been definitively established. The case remains a chilling reminder of the darkness that can exist beneath the surface of society.
