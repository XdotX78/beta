# Gaia Explorer: Project Roadmap

## Vision Statement

Gaia Explorer aims to become the premier platform for exploring global events, historical developments, and unexplained phenomena through interactive maps. Our vision is to create an educational, engaging, and visually stunning experience that connects users with the world around them, both past and present.

## Current Status (March 2025)

The platform currently includes three core map experiences:

1. **News Map**: Real-time visualization of global events and news
2. **Mysteries Map**: Interactive exploration of unexplained phenomena and mysteries
3. **History Map**: Timeline-based historical event visualization with 3D globe integration

Each component provides a unique lens through which users can understand our world, supported by interactive UI elements, responsive design, and visually compelling representations.

## Cross-Platform Enhancement Priorities

The following roadmap outlines platform-wide improvements that will enhance all map components:
