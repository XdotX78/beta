# News Map - Development Notes

## Regional Division Approach

### Primary Geographic Divisions
- **Americas**: North America, Central America, South America, Caribbean
- **Europe**: Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe
- **Asia**: East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, Middle East
- **Africa**: North Africa, West Africa, East Africa, Central Africa, Southern Africa
- **Oceania**: Australia, Pacific Islands

### Benefits of Regional Division
- **Comprehensive coverage** - Every part of the world has a place
- **Intuitive organization** - Users can easily find regions geographically
- **Scalable** - Works well even when content is sparse in certain regions
- **Unbiased** - Doesn't prioritize certain countries based on current events
- **Educational** - Helps users understand geographic relationships

## Modular Scraping System Architecture

### System Structure
```
/scrapers
  scraper_core.py         # Core functionality shared across all regions
  /modules
    north_america.py      # Region-specific scraping logic
    south_america.py
    western_europe.py
    eastern_europe.py
    ...etc
  /config
    sources.json          # News sources by region
    keywords.json         # Region-specific keywords/entities
  /utils
    geo_parser.py         # Utilities for geo-tagging content
    content_cleaner.py    # Content sanitization
```

### Core Scraper Responsibilities
- Managing the scraping queue
- Rate limiting and politeness rules
- Error handling and retries
- Data storage/database interactions
- Scheduling and concurrency

### Regional Module Responsibilities
- Register its target sources
- Implement any region-specific parsing logic
- Handle language-specific processing
- Apply regional classification rules

## Technical Considerations

### Data Collection
- Use proxy rotation or respect robots.txt to avoid overloading news sites
- Store only what you need (data minimization principle)
- Be transparent about your data collection if you have user accounts
- Implement appropriate rate limiting

### Advantages of Modular Approach
- Add new regions without touching existing code
- Update a single region when source sites change their structure
- Balance resource allocation (run more frequent scrapes for high-activity regions)
- Handle region-specific challenges (like different character sets or RTL languages)

### Data Processing
- Extract location data from news articles using NLP
- Classify articles by category (conflict, politics, disaster, economy, social)
- Sentiment analysis for highlighting particularly positive/negative news
- Importance ranking algorithm to determine pin size/visibility

### Legal Considerations
- GDPR compliance for European content
- Copyright concerns when displaying content snippets
- Attribution to original sources
- Terms of service compliance for scraped sites

## User Interface Elements

### Map Features
- LiveUAMap-inspired interface with full-screen map focus
- Light theme for better readability
- Category filters with clear visual indicators
- Proper z-index handling to ensure UI elements stay above the map
- Bounds control to prevent excessive map dragging

### News Display
- Collapsible sidebar for news feed
- Filter controls in a top bar
- Pop-up windows for detailed news viewing
- Time filters (last 24 hours, week, month)
- Search functionality for specific news topics

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Optimized data loading for mobile networks

## Data Storage

### Database Schema Considerations
- News articles with geo-tagging
- Category classification
- Timestamp information
- Source attribution
- Importance ranking

### Caching Strategy
- Regional caching to speed up map loading
- Update frequency based on region activity
- Incremental updates to minimize bandwidth

## Future Enhancements

The following ideas represent potential future developments for the News Map component:

### Real-time Capabilities
- **Live Updates**: Streaming real-time news updates with animated transitions for new events
- **Breaking News Alerts**: Push notifications for major events in user-selected regions
- **Event Timeline**: Scrubber to rewind and replay how news events unfolded chronologically
- **News Velocity Tracking**: Visual indicators showing how quickly news is developing in different regions

### Analysis Tools
- **Bias Detection**: AI-powered analysis of news source biases with transparency indicators
- **Fact-Check Integration**: Connect news items to relevant fact-checking resources
- **Multi-Source Comparison**: View how different outlets are covering the same event
- **Impact Assessment**: Visualize potential economic, social, or environmental impacts of events

### Visualization Enhancements
- **Heat Maps**: Show concentration of news activity by topic or category
- **Connection Lines**: Visualize relationships between related events across regions
- **Ripple Effects**: Animated visualization of how events in one region affect others
- **Theme-Based Map Styles**: Special map styles for different news categories

### User Personalization
- **Personal News Radar**: Custom alert zones based on user interests and locations
- **News Diary**: Save important events for later reference or research
- **Viewpoint Selection**: Choose to see news from different cultural perspectives
- **Topic Deep-Dives**: Follow the development of specific stories over time

### Integration Features
- **Social Media Overlay**: Show social media reactions to news events in different regions
- **Historical Context**: Link current events to historical precedents from the History Map
- **Economic Data Integration**: Connect news to market reactions and economic indicators
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Link news events to environmental data (weather, pollution, etc.)

### Language & Accessibility
- **Multi-language Support**: View news in original languages with instant translation
- **Text-to-Speech**: Audio narration of news summaries for accessibility
- **Low-Bandwidth Mode**: Text-only version for areas with limited connectivity
- **Readability Options**: Adjustable complexity levels for news summaries
